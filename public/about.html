<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self-taught developer. I love animations. I once lost 30 pounds working out on treadmill while watching nearly 1000 episodes of One Piece !</p>

<p>I picked up coding out of project manager full time job. I found it fun and challenging. It opens a different door for me.</p>

<p>If you have similar hobby and passion as I do, lets connect and share our thoughts and experiences.</p>
